<p style="text-align:center"><strong>How to Play</strong></p>

<p>Minesweeper is a classic single-player game that involves uncovering hidden mines on a grid-based game board without detonating them. The objective of the game is to clear the board of all hidden mines.</p>

<p>Here are the basic steps to play Minesweeper:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Open the Minesweeper game by running the program The game board consists of a grid of cells, some of which contain hidden mines.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Left-click on any cell to reveal what&#39;s hidden underneath. If the cell is empty, it will display a number indicating the number of mines in the surrounding cells. If the cell contains a mine, the game is over, and you lose.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use the information from the revealed cells to determine the location of the mines. If a cell shows the number 1, for example, there is one mine in one of the eight adjacent cells. If a cell shows the number 2, there are two mines in two of the eight adjacent cells, and so on.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If you suspect a cell contains a mine, right-click on it to place a flag. This helps you keep track of the cells that you think are mined. To remove a flag, simply right-click on the flagged cell again.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Continue uncovering cells and flagging potential mines until you have cleared the board of all mines. If you uncover all the empty cells, the game is also over, and you win.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Keep in mind that Minesweeper is a logic-based game, so use your brain to uncover as many cells as possible without detonating any mines. Practice makes perfect, so keep playing to improve your skills.</p>
